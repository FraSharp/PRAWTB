# TODOs

- [ ] Allow getting posts from more than 1 subreddit.
- [ ] Make _$RequestURL_ generation faster.
- [ ] Get every new post since when the bot has been offline, this means that _$limit_ can't be hardcoded
       on such situations.
- [x] Handle more than 1 post at a time.
- [ ] Fix _$LastTitle_ implementation (in order not to send the same post more than 1 time).
